# MIMIC-III
Resources scheduling is an important task of Healthcare Management Systems. The right scheduling of doctors and nurses aids on the improved resources utilization.  But the volume of newly admitted patients and unrelenting hospital operations make the task challenging.  The different types of patients tend to have different types of medical histories.  Hence, building a generalized model  to  read  records  of  all  the  patients  effectively  is  a  challenge.   This  project  discusses about  a  generalized  neural  network  model  to  predict  patients’  span  in  the  hospital  by using  doctors'  natural  language  writing  data  and  general  numeric  inputs.   The  model  is useful to represent most of the patients’ maximum information available via doctor’s writings.  Also, numeric data aids more information for majority of the patients.  The model is implemented for ICU patients’ database.  Different experiments are done in different hyper-parameters setups to find the better model.  Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Deviation and R squared score are used as the measures of performance to choose the most efficient model.
